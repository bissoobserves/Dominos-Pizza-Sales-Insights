The primary goal of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of the sales data using SQL queries to uncover key business insights and create an interactive dashboard using PowerBI.
The dataset includes comprehensive information about each pizza sale, such as:

- Order Details:  order_id, order_date, and order_time.
- Product Information:  pizza_name, pizza_name_id, pizza_category, pizza_size, and pizza_ingredients.
- Sales Metrics:  quantity, unit_price, and total_price.


The analysis answers critical questions such as:

- What are the most and least popular pizzas?
- Which pizza sizes are sold the most?
- How do sales vary by month, day, and time?
- What is the total revenue and how does it trend over time?
